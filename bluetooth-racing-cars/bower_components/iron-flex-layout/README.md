##&lt;iron-flex-layout&gt;


The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use [CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes), also known as flexbox. This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:

1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes). The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules. Layout classes let you specify layout properties directly in markup.

2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html). The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.

A complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.
